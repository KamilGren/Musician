## Why?
Hi. Welcome to my new application. Its a great pleasure for me to write something like this.
Its writing for passion so I decided to not use any web frameworks. It's standard Java application which I'm writing in JavaFX.  
It also help me to know Java more deeply. 

## Technologies

- Java 17
- JavaFX 17
- Maven

## What you can find here and why it's interesting?

In my application you can easily find 60 chords which we can play on guitar and 10 scales to use.
You can look how chords and scales are displaying on fretboard, so for you its much easier to play anything
and learn fretboard on your classical guitar! If you have your guitar pick up it and try for example play scale in phrygiant dominant (9) in E. Sounds good, yeah? ;)

## What next?

I'm working with more difficult things which needs time for implement. 
Now I'm working on create tonic, subdomninant and dominant chords for all of scales.
After this I will improve scales, make sounds for notes and create possibility of upload some tabs which application can play.
