## Why?
Hello! Its my interesting application about music theory on guitar! All you need to know to start playing is to run application and choose some staff like chords or scales! Its easy! Its not all! Read :) 
But okey, why? Because I love to to play on guitar and I also love programming some technical staff. Here we have "kills two birds with one stone" but for sure i'm not going to kill anybody. I'm vegan. Yes, even in Readme I'm writing about it. Okey. Lets go!

## Technologies

- Java 17
- JavaFX 17
- Maven

## What you can find here and why it's interesting?

In my application you can easily find 60 chords which we can play on guitar and 9 guitar scales to use (in all of tones!).
You can look how chords and scales are displaying on fretboard, so for you its much easier to play anything and learn fretboard on your classical guitar (acoustic guitar too). If you have your guitar pick up it you can easily try this application. Maybe you find something interesting for you?

If you want to have some informations about chord patterns use info button which is located on the right side of application. You see here chords arranged in CAGED system on whole fretboard. At this moment I have working 5 positions for major 3 notes chords (to choose via buttons).

Intereseting for you can be circle of fifth which is shown for most of common scales used in music! You can easily find what you want. Look!

Application also shows chords I-VII (tonic, dominant, subdominant and more..) for **all positions** of used scales in my application which is important element for music harmony! Here is example of how its works:

## What next?

We will see. Maybe notes to tabs transcription? Maybe something with rhytm, maybe sound? It will be journey to create this.... 

Have a good experience
